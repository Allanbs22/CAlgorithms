# CAlgorithms
A list of several algorithms implemented in C using GTK in Linux
Developed in 2018 with the help of Herwin Mejias

The list of algorithms available is the following:

- Matrix multiplication
- Knapsack problem
- Equipment replacement
- Shortest path
- Sports series
- Binary tree search

There is a menu to choose which algorithm to try, but each one of them also works as an independent program.
You can also save the use cases of each algorithm for testing later.
