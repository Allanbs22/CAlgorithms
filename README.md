# CAlgorithms
A list of several algorithms implemented in C using GTK in Linux
Developed in 2018 with the help of Herwin Mejias

The list of algorithms available is the following:

- Matrix multiplication
- Knapsack problem
- Equipment replacement
- Shortest path
- Sports series

There is a menu to choose which algorithm to try, but each one of them also works as an independent program.
